Docker:
-------

Application development:
-> collection of programs is called as a software project
-> software project contains serveral components
    1) forntend components (UI) 
    2) backend components (Business Logic)
    3) database components (Persistence Logic)


       ui   ----------------   web components  ------------ business components  ----------- persistent components    ---------> Databases
-------forntend-----------        ----------------------------------Backend------------------------------------------------              MySQL,PLSQL, MongoDB
    - HTML, CSS, JS, Jquery, Bootstrap                       -   java, Django

For developing different application we need different software to install.
Eg: HTML,CSS, JS, Jquery, Bootstrap, JAVA 1.8v ,MySQL etc. 
We have different environment for building end to end project.
These are the different environment->
    - Dev environment java 11
    - SIT environment java 1.5 ( tester system integration test  )
    - UAT environment Java 13
    - Pilot environment ( pre prod environment)
    - Production environment Java 1.6 ( Live environment )
for example : Dev environment: linux, Java 1.8v + spring boot 3+ Mysql 8.5
we have to install all the above application in all environments.
if we install software in different environment there is high chance of getting errors.
so we need docker containerization concept which will help us to build and deploy 
our applications easily without installing any other dependencies on system level .

- In order to deploy our application in machine we need to setup all 
the software which are required to our application.
Ex: OS, Java 1.8v, Mysql, Tomcat web server 9.0V etc.

- In realtime project should be deployed into multiple environments for testing purpose.
Ex: Dev, SIT, UAT, PILOT, Production
    -   Dev env will be used by development to perform integration testing
    - SIT env is used by testing team to test functionality of the application.
    - UAT env is used to by client to test functionality of the application
    - PILOT env means pre-Production testing env
    - Production env is live environment


    - Devployment this are in different environment is difficult to manage.
    - Compatability issues
    - To deploy application to these many environment we need to take of all the software required to run our application in all environment. It is very difficult task.


Docker:
    - Docker is set of platforms as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software packages called containers.




virtualization:
--------------
- Installing multiple guest operation system in one host operation system.
- Hypervisor is used to achieve this.
- It is old technique to run the application.
- We need to install all the required softwares in HOST OS to run our application-> system performance will become slow in this process,
- Virtual Machine(VM): it is new technology to virtualize hardware resources.

- To overcome the problems of virtualization we are going for containerization concept.


containerization:
----------------
- It is used to package all the software and application code in one container for execution.
- container will take care of everything which is required to run our application.
- we can run the containers in multiple machine easily.
- docker is containerization software.
- Using docker we will create container for our application
- Using docker we can create image for our application
- Docker Images we can share easily to multiple machine.
- Using docker image we can create docker container and we can execute it.



                                          -------- Docker container (machine 1)
        App with docker ---- docker image -------- Docker container (machine 2) 
                                          -------- Docker container (machine 3)

Docker will take care of dependencies.
Docker is a containerization software.
Docker will take care of application and application dependencies for execution
deployment into multiple environment will become easy if we use docker containers concept
