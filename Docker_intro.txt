Docker:
-------

Application development:
-> collection of programs is called as a software project
-> software project contains serveral components
    1) forntend components (UI) 
    2) backend components (Business Logic)
    3) database components (Persistence Logic)


       ui   ----------------   web components  ------------ business components  ----------- persistent components    ---------> Databases
-------forntend-----------        ----------------------------------Backend------------------------------------------------              MySQL,PLSQL, MongoDB
    - HTML, CSS, JS, Jquery, Bootstrap                       -   java, Django

For developing different application we need different software to install.
Eg: HTML,CSS, JS, Jquery, Bootstrap, JAVA 1.8v ,MySQL etc. 
We have different environment for building end to end project.
These are the different environment->
    - Dev environment java 11
    - SIT environment java 1.5 ( tester system integration test  )
    - UAT environment Java 13
    - Pilot environment ( pre prod environment)
    - Production environment Java 1.6 ( Live environment )
for example : Dev environment: linux, Java 1.8v + spring boot 3+ Mysql 8.5
we have to install all the above application in all environments.
if we install software in different environment there is high chance of getting errors.
so we need docker containerization concept which will help us to build and deploy 
our applications easily without installing any other dependencies on system level .

- In order to deploy our application in machine we need to setup all 
the software which are required to our application.
Ex: OS, Java 1.8v, Mysql, Tomcat web server 9.0V etc.

- In realtime project, we should be deployed into multiple environments for testing purpose.
Ex: Dev, SIT, UAT, PILOT, Production
    -   Dev env will be used by development to perform integration testing
    - SIT env is used by testing team to test functionality of the application.
    - UAT env is used to by client to test functionality of the application
    - PILOT env means pre-Production testing env
    - Production env is live environment
    - Devployment this are in different environment is difficult to manage.
    - Compatability issues
    - To deploy application to these many environment we need to take of all the software required to run our application in all environment. It is very difficult task.


Docker:
    - Docker is set of platforms as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software packages called containers.




virtualization:
--------------
- Installing multiple guest operation system in one host operation system.
- Hypervisor is used to achieve this.
- It is old technique to run the application.
- We need to install all the required softwares in HOST OS to run our application-> system performance will become slow in this process,
- Virtual Machine(VM): it is new technology to virtualize hardware resources.

- To overcome the problems of virtualization we are going for containerization concept.

Advantages:
-----------
- multiple Os in same machine
- Easy maintenace and recovery
Lower total cost of ownership

Disadvantages:
--------------
- Multiple VMs lead to unstable performance
- Hypervisor are not as efficient as host Os
- Long boot-up process


containerization:
----------------
- It is used to package all the software and application code in one container for execution.
- container will take care of everything which is required to run our application.
- we can run the containers in multiple machine easily.
- docker is containerization software.
- Using docker we will create container for our application
- Using docker we can create image for our application
- Docker Images we can share easily to multiple machine.
- Using docker image we can create docker container and we can execute it.

Advantages:
-----------
Containers on same OS kernel are lighter and smaller
Better resource utilization campared to VMs
Short boot-up process 

                                          -------- Docker container (machine 1)
        App with docker ---- docker image -------- Docker container (machine 2) 
                                          -------- Docker container (machine 3)

Docker will take care of dependencies.
Docker is a containerization software.
Docker will take care of application and application dependencies for execution
deployment into multiple environment will become easy if we use docker containers concept




Application development stack:
------------------------------
- HTML content and templates
- CSS style sheets
- JavaScript including frameworks such as Angular or reactjs
- Build tools such as maven and Gradle
- Web server such as Apache
- Server-side runtime and frameworks including nodejs, PHP, python, Ruby, .net, Java etc
- Databases such as MySQL, Maria DB, SQL server, MongoDB
- Other services for caching and message queues (Redis, Kafka)
- Git and Github for source control


We have to execute our application in multiple machine.
How do we know it will on all machine?
If any changes happen then how do we update that change across machines?
What about security issues?


Issues with development Stack setup:
------------------------------------
- You use a MacOS, they use Windows
- You developed the app usign java 1.8v and they have java 11v installed.
-you used MongoDB v3.6 they are using v4.2



What is Docker?
- Docker is a platform for packing, deploying and running applciation.
- Docker enables you to separate your application from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.
- Docker package software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to 
    run including libraries, system tools code and runtime.
- It helps you build applications faster by providing an isolated environment where your code runs without 
    affecting other apps on your system.
- By taking advantages of docker methodologies for shipping, testing and deploying code quickly
     you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.



Docker Architecture:
--------------------
![docker architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/docker/images/docker_architecture.jpg)
- Docker uses client -server model where client talks to server over REST API.
- Client can be local system like your laptop or remote system like AWS EC2 instance.
- The client sends request to server which executes instructions given by user.
- Server builds an image from Dockerfile provided by user.
- Image contains everything required to run the application i.e binaries, libraries, configuration files, scripts etc..
- Image contains everything required to run the container.
- Container runs applications inside images created by users.



            Docker file --------> Docker image  ----------> Docker Container
                         Build                     Run 

Docker terminology:
------------------
- Image: It's read only template of OS environment.
- Container : A single process running within docker image.
- Dockerfile: Contains set of commands needed to build docker image.
- Registry: Is a place where you store your docker images.
- Repository: Repository is collection of related docker images.
- Tag: Tag is name given to each version of repository.
- Push & Pull  : Push command uploads new image into registry whereas pull downloads existing image from registry.


 Docker commands:
 ----------------

 Install Docker software:
 -----------------------
 In ec2 instance(Amazon linux machine):
                       sudo yum update -y
                       sudo yum install docker -y   // install docker into amazon linux
                       
                       
Add user to docker group by executing below command
                        sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user
                            // to start docker 
                        sudo service docker start
                        docker info // check docker info

                   // restart session
                        exit
                        docker info


Docker Command:
---------------
1) To run the hello world example, execute following command
$ docker run busybox echo "Hello World"  # Run 'echo' command inside 'busybox' image
Hello World                                # Output should be Hello World
```

// See docker info
docker info

// to see docker images execute below command
docker image

// pulling hello-world docker image
docker pull hello-world

// docker version
docker -v

// for login into docker account (we need to create docker account )
docker login

// for list of img commands used in docker 
docker help


docker pull <image-id>  # download that image (docker pull mysql)
docker run <image-id> # check the image is present in local or not(if not downloaded it will download i.e, pull that image ) and then run that image 
docker build
docker tag
docker push
docker rmi <image-id>  # delete that image 
docker ps


                            build                           run
                Dockerfile --------------> Docker image  --------------> Docker container
                                                |
                                                |
                                                |
                                                |
                                            docker hub
 
 Docker terminology:
 --------------------
Dockerfile: Dockerfile contains instructions to create an image. it contain docker domain specific keywords to build image
Docker Image: Docker image is package which contains everything(App code+ software +env+ libraries)
Docker container:Docker container is run time instance of docker image. Our application will execute in docker container 
Docker registry(Docker hub ): it is a place where we store docker images.
Docker engine(Docker demon):It is a software using which we will create docker images and docker container 

- Docker hub is public registry.
- In private company Nexus, Jforg, D.T.R, AWS ECR are private registries.


How to create our own docker image?
=---------------------------------=
1. we need a Dockerfile
login into docker hub
                        docker login
Create a Dockerfile
    vi Dockerfile
    Insert Dockerfile
        FROM ubantu
        RUN echo "Run One"
        RUN echo "Run Two"
        CMD echo "Echo from Image"
        CMD echo "Echo from Latest"
        CMD echo "Run Three"

    To build docker image, dockerfile is needed.
    docker build -t myfirstimage .
    ------ "docker build" is to build our first image. --------
    "-t" is to tell our image name
    " myfirstimage " is the name of our docker image
    . tells to search from currect directory


                                 build    (myfirstimage)      run
                Dockerfile --------------> Docker image  --------------> Docker container
                                                |
                                                |  (push)
                                                |
                                                |
                                            docker hub
                                            (public repo)
    docker run myfirstimage 
    o/p: Echo from last 

    myfirstimage is now in local machine.
    we can store image in our docker hub account.
    - docker tag myfirstimage narendra/myfirstimage
    - docker push narendra/myfirstimage
    before pushing into docker hub we need to tag that image.



DockerFile:
-----------
- Dockerfile contains instructions to build docker image.
- In dockerfile we will use DSL(Domain specfic Language) keywords.
- Docker engine will process Dockerfile instructions from top to bottom.
- Bellow are docker file keywords
        FROM, MAINTAINER, COPY, ADD, RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, ENV, LABEL, USER, WORKDIR, EXPOSE, VOLUME


FROM: it indicates base image to run our application. On top of the base image we will create our own image.
-----
Syntax: FROM <image-name>
example: 
FROM   java:jdk-1.8.0
FROM    tomcat:9.2
FROM   mysql     
- If we dont tell version it will take latest version.         

MAINTAINER : It's used for giving authorship information about an image.
------------
syntax: MAINTAINER "<NAME>" <<EMAIL>>
example: MAINTAINER Narendra "<narendra@gmail.com>"
- MailId is optional.

COPY:It is used to copy files/ folder to image while creating an image.
-----
Syntax: COPY <source> <destination>
copying war file from target directory to tomcat/webapps directory. 
Eg: COPY target/maven-web-app.war /local/tomcat/webapp/maven-web-app.war


ADD:    It is also used to copy files to image while creating an image.
====
- Add keyword can download files from remote location (http)
- add keyword will extract tar file while copying to image.

Syntax:
ADD <source> <destination>
ADD <url-to-download> <destination>

What is the difference between COPY and ADD?
--------------------------

RUN: It is used to execute commands on top of base image.
--- 
- Run command instruction will execute while creating an image.
- we can write multiple RUN instruction, they will execute in the order (from top to bottom)
Ex; RUN mkdir workspace , RUN yum install git 

CMD: This instruction tells which command should be executed when container runs as a daemon.
====
- This is default command which executes when container starts up in interactive mode or detached mode.
 
                    build               run
        Dockerfile ------> docker image ---> Docker container 
                    download git        start tomcat server 
                        (RUN)               (CMD) 
                    while creating image        while creating container 

container creating means application execution.
EX: CMD sudo start tomcat
- we can multiple CMD instructions in DockerFile but docker will process only last CMD instruction.
- There no use of writing multiple CMD instructions in Dockerfile.


Demo Dockerfile:
---------

FROM ubantu # it will download lastest ubantu image.
MAINTAINER Narendra
RUN echo "Run one"
RUN echo "Run Two"
CMD echo " CMD One"
RUN echo "Run three"




















*FROM : Sets base image for new Docker image.
*RUN : Executes command on current image and creates layer with result.
*CMD : Specifies default commands which should be executed when running this image as container.
*EXPOSE : Exposes port inside the container without publishing it to host system's ports.
*ENV : Defines environment variable within the scope of an instruction or Dockerfile.
*ADD : Copies files or directories from <src> location to destination path specified by <dest>.
*COPY : Similar to ADD but does not allow wildcards like * , ** etc..
*VOLUME : Creates mount point for externally mounted volumes or named volume.
*WORKDIR : Changes working directory where all subsequent commands would execute.
*ARG : Used to pass a value at build time.
*ONBUILD : Adds trigger instruction when used with other instructions such as FROM, COPY, WORKDIR, USER, ONBUILD triggers another instruction whenever the
